            <p>This is written out of Lukas' perspective. Holly's perspective on Lukas can be found <a href="http://localhost:2368/lukas/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Holly is a 14 year old girl with a story, not quite usual for that age. <br />
Born in California near Costa Mesa, she moved to Portland which ever since is what her heart feels as 'home'.</p>

<p>She has seen a lot of great places in America, but not just there, also many exciting places in Europe, such as Latvia and Iceland, before she went to Ireland, where she should would go to school for a year - and meet me. Her story has much more that, as for example she has been to London too, seen a good amount of Ireland... and... travelled to Roma, Seville, Portugal and once more Spain. <em>I'm very jealous of all she has seen and am absolutely happy for her.</em></p>

<p>As for personality, Holly is one of the most understanding people I have ever gotten to meet. She always wants the best for people, tries not to hurt them. She is patient and a exceptionally good listener. Her love for nature is undoubtedly existent. She loves to see anything that can be found outside, loves to see it breath, in all kinds of views, may the sun shine or the rain fall down to the ground.</p>

<p>She is a joyous person, smiling and laughing everytime she can, making one feel very safe and happy with it as well. Her more serious looks do certainly make one thoughtful and sometimes feel worried. Curiosity... a feature, a trait, no... a quality of hers that, I personally have always loved about her (Maybe one that was essential to get us where we are today).</p>

<p>She lives for all moments, not a single one should be gone anytime. Writing it down, capturing it, or memorizing it by looking and feeling it's tiniest details are ways of her to never forget what she once has discovered. And her passion and smiles for exactly these moments is exceptionally catching. I believe that is - and many other reasons - why she is so interested in Photography.</p>

<p>She looks fit, but you wouldn't assume what kind of jock (I may be exaggerating a little with this statement) she actually is. Long before I knew her, she had already done football, to not get confused, I am talking about soccer and Lacrosse too. Hockey was her replacement for Lacrosse for the time she had been in Ireland, even though it wasn't her favorite thing to do. At least sometimes.</p>

<p>Everyone loves good conversations, and so does Holly. One can have very intense discussions about actually any topic really. Sometimes, I can't quite believe how we come up together looking at details of things, which usually wouldn't be looked at or talked about. The moments after such discussions are often very happy and smiley.</p>

<p><em>More to follow soon...</em></p>
